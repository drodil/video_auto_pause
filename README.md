# Youtube Auto Pause

This is a Chrome extension that pauses Youtube videos when losing the tab/window focus by
sending event to the player. Resumes the playback once the Youtube tab/window is back in focus.

Also listens for computer lock events and when the video goes out of viewport
(for example when reading comments below).

Features some useful keyboard shortcuts to control videos in the window.
