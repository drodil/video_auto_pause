back in focus.

## Contributing

Please feel free to contribute with pull requests or by creating issues. In case
the extension does not work, please also list all other extensions you have
enabled as this might conflict with other extensions.

## TODO

* Add icons for the extension
* Better way to check if video is actually plaing
* Support for other video services
* Publish in the chrome web store
